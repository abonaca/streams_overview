\begin{abstract}
- streams, tidal debris, useful for tracing hierarchical assembly, dark matter 
- in the Milky Way, the Gaia mission, providing astrometry and spectrophotometry for billions of stars, fundamentally changed the landscape
- we discuss three main revolutions:
-- number of streams increased by an order of magnitude, now have a population of 100 (New streams and methods for discovery thanks to new kinds of data)
-- orbital histories (including hierarchical associations between streams)
-- Stream features are abundant (revealed at low surface brightness)
Implications heralding exciting times ahead!
-- pragmatic: Due to more secure membership probabilities, follow-up now more efficient so the chemistries now becoming more readily available
-- Due to large number of streams, transitioning from stamp-collecting to population studies
-- All of this will need improved theoretical modeling of the new Gaia discoveries

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
% AB
% storytelling prose

- what happens when two galaxies approach (toomre)
- what happens to a dwarf galaxy when it approaches a more massive galaxy
- theory of tidal stripping
-- Shell vs stream, radial vs tangential
-- Dwarf vs. globular cluster

- much of this theory developed bc stuff seen in arp's catalog?
- where observed: extragalactic -- interacting galaxies, streams, shells
- took some time to discover in the mw, looking from the inside
- mw halo discoveries in new surveys: hipparcos (phase-mixed), 2MASS, SDSS (coherent)

- Mergers common, expected in dm universe
- tracers in the MW halo, evidence of hierarchical galaxy formation, predicted in the dm paradigm
- but also more direct tracer of dm: distribution on large, galactic, and small, subgalactic, scales

- Sgr halo shape controversy, big news triaxial, resolved tension w kinematics + a more flexible model
- But Rvs hard observationally, need spectroscopy, more time-consuming, in addition targets are sparse, so follow-up inefficient, even hard even beyond just the lack of appropriate observational capabilities

- even worse, indications streams individually don't give a full picture (Sgr vs Pal5, GD-1 X Pal5)
- need a more complex model, could be constrained with more streams, local tracers
- and while deeper surveys always discovered more streams, their coverage is limited, while the large area photometric surveys tapped out at current depth
- combined with the low availability of rvs, we hit a limit to tracing large scale dm

- on the other hand: progress made w substructure
- carlberg papers
- but, are density variations real?: contrast the issue, contamination from the field mw stars

- so by 2014, we had x streams discovered, methods developed, tested, but at a standstill on both the mass and shape of our dark matter halo, as well as the amount of substructure.
- a prominent astronomer at an IAU Symposium 311 voiced a frustration at the lack of progress by exclaiming ``Where is the beef with streams?!'' \citep{binney:2014}.
- fortunately, a few months earlier (dec 2013), a new observatory had been launched: Gaia 
- gaia was designed to do this (list capabilities)
% - needed gaia: designed to do that (find original science case)
- in the past half-decade, we have been reaping the rewards (cite gaia collaboration papers with science exposes)
- the resulting data also uncovered phase-mixed + in the disk, no room to give justice to everything
- but it is the coherent streams in the halo that brought major paradigm shifts, and will be our focus

- for a sneak preview: 
-- outline individual sections
-- identify key summary figures?
-- state we identify key opportunities for breakthroughs
-- reflect on the changes awaiting us in the future due to these discoveries in the concluding section

% - Tidal debris
% -- How they form, What are they?
% -- Dwarf vs. globular cluster
% -- Shell vs stream, radial vs tangential
% -- Here focus on still coherent debris, not phase-mixed structures

% - First discoveries (Sgr, Pal 5, Helmi - first orbital clustering, the slow trickle of photometric streams, …)
% - Motivation for what they tell us based on theory / early 2000s work
% - Fitting orbits to streams and then stream =/= orbit
% - All the things that streams are sensitive to: subhalos, bar, spiral arms, GMCs, internal DF/dissolution

% - Why were we at a standstill on many/all of these before Gaia?
% - major shifts in the field of stellar streams post Gaia:
% -- explosion in the number of streams discovered (\S~\ref{sec:discovery})

% APW Note:
- Make sure we note that the focus here is on streams accreted, not disk / star cluster
streams. Or kinematic substructures in the local velocity field (e.g., helmi stream,
moving groups, Hipparcos UV structure, etc.)

\section{Stream discoveries in the \gaia\ era}
\label{sec:discovery}
% APW

\textbf{Summary}: Stellar streams inherently have low stellar densities and their
constituent stars are typically far from the Sun, making them difficult to observe.
Finding and characterizing streams is therefore all about enhancing \emph{contrast} over
the background stars, either by filtering datasets to increase the relative occurrence
of stream stars in the filtered set, or by restricting the search to rare tracers that
are more likely to be found in streams than in the background (e.g., blue horizontal
branch stars that are common to old, metal-poor stellar populations).
The first streams and substructures around the Milky Way were discovered this way by
filtering photometric data for stars in the Galactic halo, where the background stellar
density is also lower.
Subsequent discoveries were made with deeper or wider-area photometry surveys, or by
combining photometric and spectroscopic information (e.g., radial velocities).
The largest explosion in the number of known streams has come only over the last few
years thanks to data from the \gaia\ Mission.
The astrometric data from \gaia\ has revolutionized our ability to find kinematic
sub-structures because it is now possible to combine photometric and kinematic data for
enormous samples of stars.
In this section, we summarize the methods used to find streams in the pre-\gaia\ era and
highlight new methods that are now possible thanks to the all-sky kinematic data
available from \gaia.
We provide a brief census and summary of the streams that have been published up to now,
but note that this is still an active area for discovery and characterization.
We also discuss the limitations of the \gaia\ data and the need for future astrometric
surveys to push our understanding of the Milky Way's stellar halo and its dark matter
content to fainter magnitudes and larger distances.

% Cite: Many of Carl's papers, Mario Mateo Carbon stars in Sgr, Majewski Sgr, Belokurov, Ibata stuff
The first stellar streams discovered around the Milky Way --- the Sagittarius stream
(Sgr) and the Palomar 5 stream (Pal 5) --- were found in the late 1990s and early 2000s
as over-densities of stars that connect back to their progenitor systems (the
Sagittarius dwarf galaxy and the Palomar 5 globular cluster).
These discoveries, and most of the halo stellar streams found through the early 2000's,
were found using photometry alone.
The advent of wide-area, deep, multi-band sky surveys (especially the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey, SDSS, and the Two Micron All Sky Survey, 2MASS) were crucial for this initial
phase of stream discovery.
The most effective method for using photometric data to identify streams is to apply a
``matched filter'' \citep{Rockosi:2002} to the color--magnitude distribution of stars
to preferentially select or up-weight stars that are likely to be distant and low
metallicity.\footnote{We remind the reader that the focus here is on stellar streams
from accreted dwarf galaxy or globular cluster progenitor systems, which are expected to
be old and metal-poor.}
These filters can be used as a boolean selection (e.g., select all stars within some
region of color and magnitude defined by isochrones) or as a weighting function (e.g.,
weight all stars by the probability that they are near an isochrone for an old and
metal-poor stellar population).
To then find the streams, the filtered data was typically then displayed in sky
coordinates, sometimes by making movies that step the filter in distance modulus, and
maps of stellar density were smoothed and visually inspected for curving or linear
over-densities of stars.
Automated detection methods were explored \todo{Carl played with Hough transform -- does
he have a paper discussing this?}, but this was the early days for computer vision and
machine learning, and most stream discoveries (even through the 2010's) was done by
visual inspection.

The first stream discoveries motivated the development of more sophisticated methods to
identify lower surface brightness, less spatially coherent, and more distant streams
using a myriad of techniques.
(talk about kinematic streams, great circle counts, check galstreams and sort by discovery date, look at papers)
- Then Pan-STARRS, DES
- attempts to find tails around globular clusters

- Then Gaia
- More dimensions = better contrast for finding low density things
- Greatly improved contrast for nearby streams (GD-1)
- Enabled more automated searches: streamfinder, Buckley method, ... others??

- Challenge: Most streams are ~20 kpc, to MSTO out of Gaia magnitude limit





Finding and characterizing

- Finding streams is all about contrast / signal to noise over background
- Filter data, use rare tracers found in low-metallicity populations (K/M giants, RR Lyrae, HB stars)

- Sagittarius - dwarf galaxy stream. Ibata first, but then  M giants (Majewski, but what paper before?). Possible because high density in stream and low background (halo).
- Photomeric surveys became important here once filtering methods devised (matched filter for metal-poor main sequence)


- First leap in discovery rate came from large-area photometric surveys - first SDSS, Pal 5, GD-1, Orphan
- Filter and squint method for discovery - follow-up with spectroscopy to characterize
- Spectroscopic

, Pan-STARRS, DES)

- Data from the \gaia\ Mission has revolutionized our ability to find kinematic substructures, led to the explosion in number of streams discovered
- Enabled by semi-automated methods - past methods stream-by-stream, natural evolution for a field
- In the future, hope to have fully automated methods to enable assessing selection function, population studies
- Still, Gaia not end-all, be-all -- faint limit is an issue (many streams found from photometric)

- Brief history of discovery methods in the pre-Gaia era (maybe move that to intro?)
- New methods with new data (combining photometry + kinematics, streamfinder)
- New discoveries and census as of 2023
- Also: follow-up now more efficient so the chemistries now becoming more readily available

- list:
-- ED-2
-- LMS-1 / Wukong

\subsection{Key opportunities}
- The point that (all - few) streams have MSTO below Gaia faint limit and what that does for density characterization (or in “stream structure” below?)
- (reorder by complexity, maybe :)): Automated discovery with quantified selection function, discovery in “hard” parts of parameter space (in the disk plane or galactic center, not tangent to sky plane, etc…), comparison to expectations from cosmological simulations and GC formation models


\section{Stream orbital histories}
\label{sec:orbits}
% AB
- a lot of what we want to do w streams is reconstructing their history
- depends on orbit!
- previously widely unknown (or rather, hard to get, so available for a few streams, but wildly unknown for most -- cite hermus hyllus stuff)
-- hermus \citep{grillmair:2014}
-- hermus, phoenix connection \citep{gc:2016}
-- bhb sdss velocities -> different orbit of hermus, not connected w phoenix \citep{martin:2018}

% - Still much unknown about most streams
- But Gaia gives us access to kinematics -> +MW model = orbits
- orbits good for:
-- membership
-- origin
-- fitting the potential
-- satellite encounters

- better membership:
-- S5 \citep{li:2022}
-- new streamfinder paper


- progenitors important: can model much better (kupper)
- hard to find (balbinot)
- before: only 2 gc streams
- gjoll--ngc3201 chemistry \citep{hansen:2020}

- gaia: low sb bc selecting on orbits
- now a huge population, key opportunity

- orbits also connected separately identified streams
- case: oc
- case: aau \citep{li:2021}
- important for accurate accounting as we're moving to more complete census

- more connections + benefit of orbits: phase-space clustering \citep{bonaca:2021}
- found origins (accreted vs in situ) + progenitor galaxies
- important for cocoon implications

- orbital plane distribution, not aligned w the vpos \citep{riley:2020}

\subsection{Key opportunities}
- More comprehensive spectroscopic follow-up, potential modeling of a flexible potential, Stellar populations and element abundances, comparison to surviving dwarf galaxies and clusters (internal properties and orbits)


\section{Stream structure}
\label{sec:structure}
% APW
- Long known sagittarius bifurcation, no clear model to reproduce
- Now: Gaps and off-track features common at low surface brightness
- E.g., GD-1, Jhelum, AAU
- also motivated uncovering low-sb in other data sets (e.g., Pal 5, Jet, Phoenix)

- track--pm misalignments (shipp, erkal, ...)

\subsection{Key opportunities}
- density modeling robust to survey selection functions and dust


\section{Outlook}
\label{sec:outlook}
- Due to large number of streams: transitioning from stamp-collecting to population studies
- All of this will need improved theoretical modeling of the new Gaia discoveries (+ outlook for the future)
- Due to more secure membership probabilities: follow-up now more efficient so the chemistries now becoming more readily available

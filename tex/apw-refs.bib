A simple color cut (g-r{$<$}0.4) reveals the tidal stream of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy, as well as a number of other stellar structures in the field. Two branches (A and B) of the Sagittarius stream are clearly visible in an RGB composite image created from three magnitude slices, and there is also evidence for a still more distant wrap behind the A branch. A comparison of these data with numerical models suggests that the shape of the Galactic dark halo is close to spherical.},

From the analysis of the path of the stream and the colors and magnitudes of its stars, the stream is \textasciitilde 20+7-5 kpc away at its nearest detection (the celestial equator). We detect a distance gradient: the stream is farther away from us at higher declination. The contents of the stream are made up from a predominantly old and metal-poor population that is similar to the globular clusters M13 and M92. The integrated absolute magnitude of the stream stars is estimated to be Mr\textasciitilde -7.5. There is tentative evidence for a velocity signature, with the stream moving at \textasciitilde -40 km s-1 at low declinations and \textasciitilde +100 km s-1 at high declinations. The stream lies on the same great circle as Complex A, a roughly linear association of H I high-velocity clouds stretching over \textasciitilde 30\textdegree{} on the sky, and as Ursa Major II, a recently discovered dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Lying close to the same great circle are a number of anomalous, young, and metal-poor globular clusters, including Palomar 1 and Ruprecht 106.},

The stream is approximately 2\textdegree{} wide and is clearly distinct from the northern tidal arm of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. The apparent width of the stream indicates a progenitor with a size and mass similar to that of a dwarf galaxy. The stream is about 21 kpc distant and appears to be oriented almost perpendicular to our line of sight. The visible portion of the stream does not pass near any known dwarf galaxies, although we cannot rule out that the stream may form the inner part of a known dwarf galaxy's orbit. The most likely explanation is that the stream constitutes the remains of a dwarf galaxy that has been completely disrupted at some point in the past. We also briefly report on the discovery of a diminutive Galactic satellite that lies near the projected path of the new stream but is unlikely to be related to it.},

The stream has no obvious association with the orbit of any known cluster or galaxy. The contrast of the detected stream is greatest when using a star count filter that is matched to the color-magnitude distribution of stars in M13, which suggests that the stars making up the stream are old and metal-poor. The visible portion of the stream is very narrow and about 8.5 kpc above the Galactic disk, suggesting that the progenitor is or was a globular cluster. While the surface density of the stream varies considerably along its length, its path on the sky is very smooth and uniform, showing no evidence of perturbations by large mass concentrations in the nearby halo. While definitive constraints cannot be established without radial velocity information, the stream's projected path and estimates of its distance suggest that we are observing the stream near the perigalacticon of its orbit.},

  abstract = {We identify new structures in the halo of the Milky Way from positions, colors, and magnitudes of five million stars detected in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Most of these stars are within 1.26d of the celestial equator. We present color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) for stars in two previously discovered, tidally disrupted structures. The CMDs and turnoff colors are consistent with those of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, as had been predicted. In one direction, we are even able to detect a clump of red stars, similar to that of the Sagittarius dwarf, from stars spread across 110 deg2 of sky. Focusing on stars with the colors of F turnoff objects, we identify at least five additional overdensities of stars. Four of these may be pieces of the same halo structure, which would cover a region of the sky at least 40\textdegree{} in diameter, at a distance of 11 kpc from the Sun (18 kpc from the center of the Galaxy). The turnoff is significantly bluer than that of thick-disk stars, yet the stars lie closer to the Galactic plane than a power-law spheroid predicts. We suggest two models to explain this new structure. One possibility is that this new structure could be a new dwarf satellite of the Milky Way, hidden in the Galactic plane and in the process of being tidally disrupted. The other possibility is that it could be part of a disklike distribution of stars which is metal-poor, with a scale height of approximately 2 kpc and a scale length of approximately 10 kpc. The fifth overdensity, which is 20 kpc away, is some distance from the Sagittarius dwarf streamer orbit and is not associated with any known Galactic structure. We have tentatively identified a sixth overdensity in the halo. If this sixth structure is instead part of a smooth distribution of halo stars (the spheroid), then the spheroid must be very flattened, with axial ratio q=0.5. It is likely that there are many smaller streams of stars in the Galactic halo.},

The matched filter algorithm provides the maximum possible signal-to-noise detection of the cluster stars over the measured background, and the expected and actual effectiveness of the technique in the context of this data set is discussed. The stellar background is examined in some detail for systematic variation as a function of Galactic position in order to assess its effect on the detection efficiency. Of the total number of Pal 5 stars detected, 45\% are out in the tails. The tails are found as the only additional 3 {$\sigma$} overdensity of cluster stars over the entire 41 deg2 area studied. The annular-averaged density of stars along the tails is fitted to a power law in radius with best-fit index -1.58+/-0.07, significantly steeper than that predicted from a constant orbit-averaged mass-loss rate.},

  abstract = {We present evidence for a ring of stars in the plane of the Milky Way, extending at least from l=180deg to 227\textdegree{} with turnoff magnitude g\textasciitilde 19.5 the ring could encircle the Galaxy. We infer that the low Galactic latitude structure is at a fairly constant distance of R=18+/-2 kpc from the Galactic center above the Galactic plane and has R=20+/-2 kpc in the region sampled below the Galactic plane. The evidence includes 500 Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopic radial velocities of stars within 30\textdegree{} of the plane. The velocity dispersion of the stars associated with this structure is found to be 27 km s-1 at (l,b)=(198deg,-27deg), 22 km s-1 at (l,b)=(225deg,28deg), 30 km s-1 at (l,b)=(188deg,24deg), and 30 km s-1 at (l,b)=(182deg,27deg). The structure rotates in the same prograde direction as the Galactic disk stars but with a circular velocity of 110+/-25 km s-1. The narrow measured velocity dispersion is inconsistent with power-law spheroid or thick-disk populations. We compare the velocity dispersion in this structure with the velocity dispersion of stars in the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy tidal stream, for which we measure a velocity dispersion of 20 km s-1 at (l,b)=(165deg,-55deg). We estimate a preliminary metallicity from the Ca II (K) line and color of the turnoff stars of [Fe/H]=-1.6 with a dispersion of 0.3 dex and note that the turnoff color is consistent with that of the spheroid population. We interpret our measurements as evidence for a tidally disrupted satellite of 2\texttimes 107 to 5\texttimes 108 Msolar that rings the Galaxy.},
